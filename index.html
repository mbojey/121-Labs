	<ul>
		<li> All labs are to be completed individually.  You may work with your classmates but everyone must submit thier own lab.
			If you work with a classmate be sure to give them credit on your work, failure to do so is academic misconduct.  If you
			have a question about a specific instance ASK BEFORE HANDING THE WORK IN.
		</li>
		<li>
			Hand in your prelabs on connect.  Prelabs will be due at the time your registered lab section starts. If you have questions about
			the prelab ask your TA at the beginning of your lab section, they will go over any questions with you. Late prelabs will not be accepted. To make the multiple choice questions use the site <a href = "https://cosc-121-mc.herokuapp.com">here</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Hand in labs on connect unless otherwise stated.  Labs will be due at the beginning of the next lab session.  Late labs will recieve a mark of 0 unless a medical note is provided or prior arrangements have been made.
		</li>
		<li>
			If you have questions about the labs the best person to ask will be your TA.  If there is not enough time in the lab period to have
			your question answered you can use the discussion forum on connect or attend office hours.
		</li>
		<li>
			Labs will be done using the work from COSC 111 labs, specifically the FeedMe game.  A copy of the source files for the game can be
			downloaded <a href = "FeedMe.zip">here</a>.  You may have made changes to the files during lab 10 in COSC 111.  The labs will still work
			with you changes if the game you made is similar to the original game.  If you are having a hard time ask your TA.
		</li>
		<li>
			At the end of each lab, after your work is graded, your TA will award one student
			with a Gold Star status in order to recognize your effort and quality of work
			produced. Students who have been award this status will earn
			<font color=red>2 bonus lab marks</font> each. Your TA will evaluate your
			effort and quality of work based on the following factors:
				<ul>

				<li> Most improved quality of work
				<li> Best program design 
				<li> Most creative solution
				<li> Best coding practices employed
				<li> Most efficient implementation
				<li> Best testing strategies employed
			</ul>
