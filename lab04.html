    <div id="section"> <h1>Objectives</h1> </div>
	<p>
		After completing this lab you will be able to:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Be comfortable working with polymorphism.
			</li>
			<li>
				Understand the benefits and power of polymorphism.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

<!-- ***************************** Pre-lab Exercises ******************************* -->
    <div id="section"> <h1>Pre-Lab Exercises - 4 points</h1> </div>
    <p>
    Complete this section individually before beginning the lab activities. This section will be due AT THE TIME YOUR LAB SECTION STARTS.
    </p>
	<p>
		Exercise 1 </br>
		<b>[1 point] </b> In your own words describe what polymorphism is.  This should only take a sentence or two.
	</p>
	<p>
		Exercise 2 </br>
		<b>[1 point] </b> You have an interface called Sprite in your program.  You are therefore able to create a variable of type Sprite i.e.
		</br>
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<tt>Sprite movingThing;</tt>
		</br>
		What would be valid types to store in this variable?  That is, what could you fill in the blanks below with?
		</br>
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<tt>movingThing = new ________________(________);</tt>
		</br>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>[2 points]</b> Make 2 multiple choice questions that review concepts about polymorphism. These questions should have 5 possible answers, 1 correct and 4 incorrect answers. Use the site <a href = "https://cosc-121-mc.herokuapp.com">here</a>
	</p> 
	<p>
		Hand in your answers before your lab section starts.

<!-- ********************************* Activity 1 ********************************* -->
    <div id="section"> <h1>Lab Activity - 8 points</h1> </div>
   <p>
<h2>What you are given:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Your work from previous labs</li>
</ul>

<h2>What you have to do:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Today all of your hard work with interfaces and inheritance will finally pay off.  
	    You will be working the concept of polymorphism to allow you to drop different types 
		of fruits with different score values each!  
	</li>
	<li><b>[1 point]</b> The first thing you will need to do it to open your <tt>Drop</tt>  
	    class.  In these classes we will need to make some changes to the targets object. 
	    Currently it is an <tt>ArrayList</tt> storing <tt>Apple</tt> objects.  We want it to store <tt>Fruit</tt> objects 
	    so that we can have both types of <tt>Fruit</tt>.
	</li>
	<ul>
	    <li><b>[1 point]</b> You will notice that this change will cause many errors in the code.  
		    To fix these errors we will need to change the type of objects stored in the <tt>ArrayLists</tt> 
			in the <tt>Board</tt> class to <tt>Fruit</tt> as well.  This will cause even more errors.
	    </li>
	    <li><b>[1 point]</b> To fix these errors we need to update any object type pulled from 
		    the <tt>ArrayList</tt> to <tt>Fruit</tt> from <tt>Apple</tt>.
	    </li>
	</ul>
	<li>Now you can add any type of fruit you want to the <tt>ArrayList</tt> of fruit to be dropped during 
	    the game.  Letâ€™s make it so that you get different <tt>Fruit</tt> everytime.
	</li>
	<li><b>[1 point]</b>In the <tt>dropIt()</tt> method of the <tt>Drop</tt> class we will want to use the random 
	    variable r to determine whether to add an <tt>Apple</tt> or a different piece of fruit.  Use the 
		mod(%) function and a conditional statement to make this dream a reality. 
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li><b>[1 point]</b>Now add a <tt>score</tt> attribute to the <tt>Fruit</tt> class.  Also write a public method
		    called <tt>getScore()</tt> that, as expected, returns the value of score.
		</li>
		<li><b>[1 point]</b>Change the constructor of the <tt>Apple</tt> and other fruit class so that they take
		    a third <tt>int</tt> parameter that is the number of points the fruit is worth.  Set the <tt>score</tt> attribute
			to this parameter.
		</li>
		<li><b>[1 point]</b>As you add the <tt>Fruit</tt> to the <tt>ArrayList</tt> we need to update to maximum possible 
		    score.  Create an attribute in the <tt>Drop</tt> class called <tt>possibleScore</tt> and store this value there. 
			This variable should be <tt>static</tt>.  Write a getter (accessor) for this attribute call it <tt>getPossibleScore()</tt>.
		</li>
		<li><b>[1 point]</b>Now you will change how we keep track of the score in the <tt>Board</tt> class and what score
    		we return to the user.  To do this change the</br><tt>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;score++</br></tt>
            line in the <tt>checkCollision()</tt> method to instead add the <tt>score</tt> of the current <tt>Fruit</tt> and change the 
			<tt>dropper.getMax()</tt> call in the <tt>paint()</tt> method to instead show the <tt>possibleScore</tt>.
		</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>What you should think about during this activity:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>What advantages does polymorphism give you in this activity? </li>
	<li>Would what we have done be possible without polymorphism?  If yes, would it be easier or harder?</li>
	<li>Are there any disadvantages to polymorphism?  If yes, what are they?</li>
	<li>In this activity we used polymorphism through inheritance, could we have used polymorphism through interfaces instead?</li>
</ul>
