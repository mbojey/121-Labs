<!-- ***************************** Pre-lab Exercises ******************************* -->
    <div id="section"> <h1>Pre-Lab Exercises - 4 points</h1> </div>
    <p>
    Complete this section individually before beginning the lab activities. This section will be due AT THE TIME YOUR LAB SECTION STARTS.
    </p>
	<p>
		Exercise 1 </br>
		<b>[2 points] </b>In lecture and in your readings (pp 323 - 329) you have seen examples of interfaces. Given the
		following description of what all classes implement an interface are required to do create an interface called <tt>PreLab.java</tt>.  
		Write the interface as if it would be used in a project, i.e. use proper syntax.
	</p>
	<p>
		Classes that implement the interface you create must have methods to access and mutate a String variable called <tt>name</tt> and an integer
		variable named <tt>count</tt>.  Classes must also have a <tt>toString()</tt> method that returns <tt>name</tt> and <tt>count</tt> as a String.
		Finally, classes that implement the interface must have a method called <tt>length()</tt> that returns an integer value and take a String as a 
		parameter.	
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>[2 points]</b> Make 2 multiple choice questions that review concepts about interfaces. These questions should have 5 possible answers, 1 correct and 4 incorrect answers. Use the site <a href = "https://cosc-121-mc.herokuapp.com">here</a>
	</p>
	<p>	
		Hand in your answers before your lab section starts.

<!-- ********************************* Activity 1 ********************************* -->
    <div id="section"> <h1>Lab Activity - 8 points</h1> </div>
   <p>
<h2>What you are given:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Your work from previous labs</li>
</ul>

<h2>What you have to do:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>In lecture you have examples of interfaces and seen the advantages 
	    it gives, such as enforcing classes to have certain methods.  Today we will be making 
	    changes to the <tt>FeedMe</tt> game to take advantage of this fact so that we 
		can enforce that all items that move on the screen, called <tt>Sprites</tt>, share
        the same methods.
	</li>
	<li><b>[1 point]</b> Rename the current <tt>Sprite</tt> class, call it <tt>Monster</tt>.
	</li>
	<li><b>[1 point]</b>Create a new interface and call it <tt>Sprite</tt>.  You create interfaces the
	    same way as you create classes in Eclipse.  Just click Interface instead of Class.
	</li>
	<li><b>[2 points]</b>Make a list of all methods common to BOTH the <tt>Fruit</tt> and <tt>Monster</tt> classes.
	    Write this list in a .txt file called <tt>similarities.txt</tt>
	</li>
	<li><b>[2 points]</b>Add all of these methods to the <tt>Sprite</tt> interface.  
	</li>
	<li><b>[2 points]</b>Make the <tt>Monster</tt> and <tt>Fruit</tt> classes use the new <tt>Sprite</tt> interface.  This is
	    done with the use of the implements keyword.  Make sure that you have no errors in your project.
	</li>
	<li>All done!  Now you know that our <tt>Monster</tt> and <tt>Fruit</tt> classes will have to have the methods you
	    declared in the interface.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>What you should think about during this activity:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>What are the other advantages of interfaces?</li>
	<li>What are some possible disadvantages of interfaces?</li>
	<li>Why do we need to have no method bodies in interfaces?</li>
	<li>We didn't use any constants in our interface.  If we had, they would need to have been 
	    <tt>static</tt>.  Why are constants <tt>static</tt> in interfaces?
	</li>
	<li>How are interfaces differeent from inheritance?</li>
</ul>
</p>
