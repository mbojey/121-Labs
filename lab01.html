    <p>
		Complete this section before beginning the lab activities.  This section will be due AT THE TIME YOUR LAB SECTION STARTS.
    </p>
    <p>
		This lab will focus on writing tests for the code that we use and using the debugger in Eclipse.  There are many ways
		to test programs that we write.  So far, the main technique that you have been taught
		has been to use print statements in your code so that the console is able to display
		what is happening in the program.  Examples of this would be printing the value of a 
		variable before it is used, i.e. i = 7, or having a statement provide an English description of what 
		code is doing at that time, i.e. "Setting the name of the dog to Bitzy.".  These print statements
		are great at letting someone who is running the code know what is happening. Today we will work to
		get those little wrinkles out of our code.

		<b>[2 points]</b> Make 2 multiple choice questions that review concepts from COSC 111 i.e. arrays, classes, methods, visibility etc.  These questions should have 5 possible answers, 1 correct and 4 incorrect answers. Use the site

<!-- ********************************* Activity ************************************ -->
    <div id="section"> <h1>Lab Activity - 8 points</h1> </div>

		<h2>What you are given:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li> <a href = "MyClass.java"><tt>MyClass.java</tt> </a>
		</ul>

		<h2>What you have to do:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Today you are given a class file that an imaginary student has written.  The student has taken
				COSC 111 but has forgotten some things over the holiday.  They wrote code that compiles but does
				not do what is desired.  Luckily, this student uses good coding practice and left us lots of good
				comments about what the code SHOULD be doing.  Your job will be to write a class that will actually
				do what the comments say this class should be doing.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>[1 point]</b>Start by creating a test class in Eclipse, call it <tt>Test.java</tt>.  In this class 
				have a main method and write tests for all of the methods in <tt>MyClass</tt>.  You should use print 
				statements so that you can see what is happening in each method.  Take the output from testing all the methods
				and put it in a file called <tt>WrongOutput.txt</tt>.  This will be handed in as part of your solutions.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>[6 points]</b> Now create a new class and write correct versions of all methods from <tt>MyClass.java</tt>.
				Correct is defined by doing what the comments say should be happening.  You can continue to use print statements 
				and looking at the code to find the errors or you can use your new skills with the debugger to speed up the process.
				When you think you have fixed everything run your test class on your new class instead of <tt>MyClass</tt>. Take the 
				output from testing all the methods	and put it in a file called <tt>CorrectOutput.txt</tt>.  This will be handed in 
				as part of your solutions.  
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>[1 point]</b> After you are done this describe a scenario, either from your experience or from your imagination,
				where writing test BEFORE writing the code would be beneficial.  Put this answer in a file called <tt>TestFirst.txt</tt>.
				This will be handed in as part of your solutions.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h2>What you should think about during this activity:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Why do we need to test our code if it does what we want when we run it?
			</li>
			<li>
				What are the advantgaes of writing good tests?
			</li>
			<li>
				How does testing apply to pair programming i.e. the group work that you did in labs last semester?
			</li>
		</ul>
